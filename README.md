# tic-tac-toe
The Odin Project´s Tic Tac Toe project in ruby

# Assignment
Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

# Goal
1. Think about how you would set up the different elements within the game… What should be a class? Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.
2. Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.

# Expectations and challenges
- Will think about structure before writing the code
- How to best store the board could be interesting. Use variables for the game states per square?
- Probably create a seperate class for just writing down the board with the current state every turn. Which takes the values per square from a class that store the states per square
- It seems trivial to create 2 players with names and ask for their input
- Loop the game until a winning or drawing state is reached
- How to check for winning states? Create a nested array filled with the variables for each square? Then match to winning states? Probably don't need to check winning states until turn 5, so keep the number of turns somehow?
